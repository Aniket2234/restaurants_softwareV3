# Restaurant POS System

## Overview

This is a comprehensive restaurant Point of Sale (POS) and management system built as a full-stack web application. The system aims to match or exceed PetPooja software in functionality, providing a complete solution for restaurant operations including billing, table management, kitchen display, inventory, staff management, reporting, and customer engagement features.

The application is designed as a single-page application (SPA) with no page reloads, featuring a professional, clean, and minimalist design approach with modern UI/UX patterns.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

**Framework & Language**: React with TypeScript, following component-based architecture with strict type safety.

**UI Component System**: Utilizes shadcn/ui components (Radix UI primitives) configured in "new-york" style with a custom design system. The component configuration supports both RSC and client-side rendering patterns.

**Styling Approach**: 
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling with custom design tokens
- CSS variables for theming (light/dark mode support built-in)
- Custom color palette defined in design guidelines featuring primary red (#E74C3C), secondary blue (#3498DB), and status colors
- Typography system using Inter, Poppins, and Roboto font families

**State Management**: Hybrid approach using React Context API and Redux Toolkit for complex state. TanStack Query (React Query) handles server state with custom query functions.

**Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing, supporting the SPA architecture.

**Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Hookform Resolvers for validation, using Yup schemas.

**Data Visualization**: Recharts for charts and analytics dashboards.

**Interactions & Animations**: 
- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- Custom hover/active states using elevation utilities
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### Backend Architecture

**Server Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript running on Node.js.

**API Design**: RESTful API architecture with routes prefixed under `/api`. The route registration system is modular and extensible.

**Database Layer**: 
- Uses MongoDB (v6) for persistent NoSQL data storage
- Direct MongoDB Node.js driver integration (no ORM)
- Connection managed through custom MongoDB service (`server/mongodb.ts`)
- Database-agnostic schema with TypeScript interfaces and Zod validation

**Data Storage Strategy**: MongoDB-based persistent storage:
- `MongoStorage`: Primary storage implementation using MongoDB collections
- All data (tables, orders, menu items, invoices, etc.) persists in MongoDB
- Automatic seed data initialization on first run (creates default floors, tables, menu items)
- Storage interface (`IStorage`) allows future migration to other databases if needed

**Session Management**: Prepared for session handling with connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL-backed sessions.

**Development Tooling**: 
- Vite for fast development server with HMR
- Replit-specific plugins for enhanced development experience
- Custom error overlays and runtime error handling

### Application Structure

**Page Organization**: Modular page components for each major feature:
- Core Operations: Dashboard, Billing, Tables, Kitchen (KDS)
- Menu & Inventory: Menu management, Inventory, Purchase Orders, Suppliers
- Customer Management: Customers, Loyalty, Reservations, Feedback
- Staff & HR: Staff, Attendance, User Roles
- Financial: Expenses, Payment Settlement, Accounting, Invoices, Tax Reports
- Marketing: Offers, Coupons, Gift Cards, Email Templates
- Analytics: Reports, Sales Analysis, Item Performance, Kitchen Performance
- System: Settings, Multi-location, Audit Logs, Backup, Integrations

**Component Architecture**:
- Reusable UI components (AppHeader, StatCard, TableCard, MenuItemCard, etc.)
- Feature-specific components (KDSOrderCard, OrderCart, CategorySidebar)
- Sidebar navigation with hierarchical menu structure
- Responsive layout with mobile detection hooks

**Design Philosophy**:
- Three-column layout for billing (category sidebar, items grid, order cart)
- Visual layouts for table management with color-coded status
- Kitchen Display System with real-time order tracking
- Single-window application principle - no page reloads
- Material Design principles for data-heavy enterprise UI

### Integrations

**Digital Menu Integration** (November 14, 2025):
- Automatic sync service that polls MongoDB `digital_menu_customer_orders` collection every 5 seconds
- Converts digital menu orders to POS orders in real-time
- Uses both tableNumber and floorNumber for accurate table matching
- Validates order totals (calculates from items and compares with digital menu total)
- Maps payment status ('paid' → 'billed', else 'active')
- Persists sync status in MongoDB (adds `syncedToPOS: true` and `syncedAt` timestamp)
- Prevents duplicate processing across server restarts
- API endpoints for status monitoring and manual sync triggers
- Preserves item-level data (spice level, notes) in POS order items
- Auto-updates table status to 'occupied' when digital menu order is synced

### Recent Changes (November 2025)

**Complete MongoDB Migration** (November 6, 2025):

- Data persists across server restarts using MONGODB_URI environment variable

**MongoDB Menu Synchronization**:
- Extended menu items schema to include `image` (URL) and `description` fields
